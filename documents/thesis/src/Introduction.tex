\subsection{Road Map}

Chapter X of this thesis discusses the background of the general SLAM problem, covering the history, use cases, and general pipeline utilized by SLAM systems. This is followed by a deeper dive into keypoint-based visual SLAM, the sensor modality targeted by this research. We provide a brief survey of widely utilized extensions to the core SLAM algorithm which target deficiencies in the core pipeline. Finally, we discuss fields outside the scope of SLAM which provide insight and methodology into this research.

Chapter X discusses works related to this research, specifically focusing on extensions targeting improved performance in dynamic situations, with additional focus given to those methods which utilize point removal optimizations.
