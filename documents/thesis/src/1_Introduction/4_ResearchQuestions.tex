\subsection{Research Questions}

\subsubsection*{Question 1: How can the historical viewpoint-dependent observability of points be modeled in order to meet the objectives laid out in Objective 1?}

To integrate historical viewpoint-dependent observability into existing change detection approaches requires a compact model of observability at the point level. Three model implementations are explored in Section \ref{sec:observability_models}, and evaluated in Section \ref{sec:observability_model_eval}.

\subsubsection*{Question 2: How does the integration of historical observability data affect the estimation of point existence confidence?}



\subsubsection*{Question 3: Can the change detection model be integrated into an existing KV-SLAM system in a way that meets the goals of Objective 2?}
