This research 

This research intends to build upon the previously developed probability models, in order to distill the update step of each map point's probability of existence into a simple Bayesian update step. The goals for this model are as follows:

1. To utilize constant additional space for each map point
2. To complete the update step in constant time
3. To resist updating confidence levels with redundant data
