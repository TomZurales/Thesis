\subsection{Motivation}

% Describe the project that inspired this work; astrobee map reuse on the ISS.

The inspiration for this research came from a project with the goal of augmenting the Astrobee robot navigation system on the International Space Station (ISS) with keypoint-based visual SLAM. At the time of the project, Astrobee navigation consisted of localization on a pre-generated map, which required both astronaut and ground team time to produce, leading to infrequent map updates \cite{soussanAstroLocEfficientRobust2022}. By augmenting the Astrobee with SLAM, we aimed to reduce the need for manual map updates and improve the robot's autonomous capabilities. Additionally, we planned to reuse maps between Astrobee operation sessions to produce consistent localization estimates, registered to the established coordinate frame of the ISS \cite{zuralesCollaborativeSensingMapping2024}. However, we found that the ISS presents unique challenges for robot navigation. The structure of the station is stable, but the contents and position of equipment changes frequently. Consequently, maps created aboard the ISS quickly become obsolete. Attempting to load outdated maps for reuse degraded Astrobee's navigation performance, limiting the robot's ability to perform autonomously and complete its mission objectives \cite{carlinoLessonsLearnedAstrobee}.

% Describe what bad things happen when SLAM systems fail

During ISS operations, the Astrobee robots would regularly lose localization. This was primarily caused by the localizer's sensitivity to lighting changes and equipment movement, leading to the Astrobee being restricted to operations within the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) \cite{carlinoLessonsLearnedAstrobee}. Trust in autonomous systems is precarious, quickly falling on the observation of failure \cite{robinetteEffectRobotPerformance2017}. The consequences of such failures can be minor, needing only minor human intervention to correct, or in the cases of autonomous cars or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can cause significant damage to people and property \cite{nahavandiComprehensiveReviewAutonomous2025a}.

% Describe why the robotics world would benefit from SLAM systems that can operate over long periods of time in changing environments.

This failure of autonomy for long-term, multi-session operations in changing environments presented a problem for Astrobee, just as it does for many other robotics applications. If solved to the point where SLAM systems could operate robustly, over long periods of time, and in highly dynamic environments, integration of robotics into human environments would be greatly simplified.
