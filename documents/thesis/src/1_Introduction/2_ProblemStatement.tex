\subsection{Problem Statement}

% A potential future use case, and 
A future use case of episodic KV-SLAM would be for operations in environments which are intermittently occupied such as workplaces. The benefit of this method is that the robot can avoid operating during highly dynamic times, with the trade-off being that the environment may be significantly changed between sessions of operation. In the case of Astrobee, the navigation system struggled to reconcile inconsistencies between the internal map and the real world, regularly requiring astronaut assistance to recover. Trust in autonomous systems is already precarious, quickly falling upon the observation of failure \cite{robinetteEffectRobotPerformance2017}. Robotic SLAM failures can lead to navigational instability, task failure, and even the possibility of physical damage to the surrounding environment or the robot itself\cite{nahavandiComprehensiveReviewAutonomous2025}. Therefore, in order for autonomous SLAM based robotic navigation to see widespread use, it must be accurate in its estimations, and capable of withstanding a wide variety of failure cases. This research focuses on reducing failures caused by the existence of outdated map features in reused maps during episodic KV-SLAM operations. For simplicity, we refer to the topic of reusing previously generated maps which have gone out of date as Outdated Map Reuse or OMR.

There are three critical issues which appear in systems which do not handle the challenges of OMR sufficiently well. The first relates to the size of the map, as only adding newly observed features without removing outdated ones results in a monotonically increasing map size. This puts an ever-increasing strain on compute resources to deal with the large map, and increases the complexity of optimization steps. The second issue concerns relocalization, which is the process by which a KV-SLAM system redetermines its position within the map after being lost. Relocalization starts by identifying candidate positions within the map which are visually similar to the current camera image. A high proportion of outdated map points in the map interferes with this candidate selection, as the map's understanding of the visual features of the environment no longer match reality. The final issue affects the RANSAC process, a function which is run regularly as part of the process of determining the 3D transformation between successive frames. The RANSAC algorithm selects a random sample of points from the map and the new image to be localized, and attempts to determine a consistent 3D transformation which explains the correspondence. High proportions of outdated map points increase the risks of the RANSAC algorithm failing to find a consistent pose for the new frame, even if one exists. The map representation, relocalization, and RANSAC will be covered in greater detail in Section \ref{sec:kv_slam_background}.

All of these issues with OMR stem from the existence of bad data in the KV-SLAM map. There are two ways to prevent such bad data from affecting the map. The first option is to proactively prevent map features which have potential to become outdated (i.e. they are located on an object that can move) from ever entering the map, therefore the map will never be outdated because no features in the map can move. The second option is to retroactively identify and remove outdated features from the map once it has been loaded for reuse. The mechanism at play in the proactive case tends to be semantic identification and segmentation of input images, allowing semantic labels to determine whether map points which fall on certain objects are kept or not. These semantic processes require significant compute and storage resources, often making them unsuitable for compute constrained applications such as small scale mobile autonomous vehicles (MAVs). In the reactive case, the methods stray away from the field of semantics, and towards the field of change detection. Change detection work by identifying inconsistencies between the map and the camera observations, flagging points for removal once confidence in their existence drops below some threshold. However, a gap can be noticed in the change detection methods available today. This operation of removing map points based on some criteria comes up a lot in SLAM, and will be referred to Map Point Removal or MPR throughout this research. While change detection methods do collect point-level metadata, to the researcher's knowledge, no change detection methods collect metadata on the global observability of each map point, leaving today's systems susceptible to overzealously flagging map points which are temporarily obstructed from certain viewpoints for removal. The semantic and change-detection methods will be discussed in greater detail in Section \ref{sec:related_work}.

The key takeaway is that OMR can greatly benefit episodic KV-SLAM systems, but without proper handling of outdated data, OMR utilization creates new failure cases which degrade the system's performance. The methods available which allow OMR to be successfully integrated make a trade-off between computational requirements, storage requirements, and effectiveness as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:omr_method_comparison}. As an engineering problem, the constraints which will drive the decision of methodology for MPR are size, weight, power, and cost. It is not always possible to just use a better computer, and in those cases, when accurate outdated MPR is needed, the available methods can fall short of requirements. The conjecture of this research that a novel change detection method which models the global observability of map features at the point level could increase the accuracy of outdated map point identification without a significant increase in computational power requirements.
