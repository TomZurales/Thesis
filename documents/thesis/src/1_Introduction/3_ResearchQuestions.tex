\subsection{Research Questions}

This thesis investigates whether a probabilistic model of map point existence utilizing directional data on map point observability can be used to identify and remove outdated 3D map points in keypoint-based visual SLAM systems. Specifically, this work seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. Can outdated map points be reliably identified using a directionally aware probability model where each map point maintains a record of its directional observability?

2. How does the inclusion of such a model impact the robustness and accuracy of a SLAM system's localization in environments exhibiting various levels of dynamic change?
