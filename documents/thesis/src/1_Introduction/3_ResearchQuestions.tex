\subsection{Research Questions}

% Is a viewpoint-aware model of map point existence an effective way to detect and cull outdated map points?

% What are the effects of this model on SLAM performance?

% Can this be implemented in a lightweight way capable of running on low-compute power platforms?

This thesis investigates whether a probabilistic model of map point existence utilizing directional data on map point observability can be used to identify and remove outdated 3D map points in keypoint-based visual SLAM systems. Specifically, this work seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. Can outdated map points be reliably identified using a directionally aware probability model where each map point maintains a record of its directional observability?

2. How does the inclusion of such a model impact the robustness and accuracy of a SLAM system's localization in environments exhibiting various levels of dynamic change?
