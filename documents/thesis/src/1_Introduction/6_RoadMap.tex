\subsection{Road Map}

Chapter \ref{sec:background} provides a high level overview of the concepts core to this research. Inner workings of KV-SLAM. Relocalization. RANSAC. Map Point Culling. Directional Statistics.

Chapter \ref{sec:related_work} digs deeper into research related to the concepts of improving long-term SLAM operations, detecting and removing extraneous data from SLAM maps, and \dots

Chapter \ref{sec:implementation} discusses the implementation details of a viewpoint-dependent historical observability model, the creation of a point removal system which implements this model, and its integration into ORB-SLAM3. Additionally, the hardware and software backing the collection and co-registration of the SLAM datasets is detailed.

Chapter \ref{sec:analysis} covers the tests performed on the observability model, the point confidence estimator, and the integrated SLAM system. Tests are performed in simulation to establish initial parameters, and on generated datasets to compare real world and simulated performance.

Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} aggregates the results from chapter \ref{sec:analysis}, and evaluates them against the defined objectives of this research to determine whether this method is an effective solution to the problems discussed so far. Areas which require further study are discussed.
