\subsection{Objectives and Scope}
\label{objectives}

% Define the scope of this work, focusing exclusively on map reuse between runs of SLAM in semi-static environments.

% Define the objectives of the model; to be lightweight and effective at identifying outdated map points, and to be usable in real-time SLAM systems.


This research

This research intends to build upon the previously developed probability models, in order to distill the update step of each map point's probability of existence into a simple Bayesian update step. The goals for this model are as follows:

1. To utilize constant additional space for each map point
2. To complete the update step in constant time
3. To resist updating confidence levels with redundant data
