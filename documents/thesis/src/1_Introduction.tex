\section{Introduction}

% Describe the entire thesis in a few sentences. What is the problem, solution and results?
The research presented in this thesis addresses a challenge common in long-term usage of SLAM systems: the need to continuously localize and map in non-static environments. We propose a novel, lightweight method for culling outdated map points from previously generated maps using a probabilistic, viewpoint-aware model of map point observability. This method is designed to operate efficiently on mobile robotics platforms with limited computational resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in identifying outdated map points, improving localization accuracy, and improving the robustness of SLAM between different runs of the system.
