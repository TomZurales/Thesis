\subsection{ORB-SLAM3}

ORB-SLAM3 is a KV-SLAM implementation which is popular in research contexts due to its performance, open source codebase, and usage of methods and techniques that are well-documented and widely understood. Figure \ref{fig:orb-slam3} shows a simplified diagram of the internal processes of ORB-SLAM3. ORB-SLAM3 supports a variety of input modalitie
