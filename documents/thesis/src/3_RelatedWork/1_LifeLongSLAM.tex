\subsection{Lifelong SLAM}

The term Lifelong SLAM has varied definitions throughout the literature, but common themes of robustness to dynamic change, and long-term operation can be seen. For simplicity, this research adopts the definition provided by Shi et al. \cite{shiAreWeReady2020}, describing lifelong SLAM as the ability for a robot to generate, maintain, and localize within a map of a particular environment over an extended period of time. This is in contradistinction to the standard SLAM operating model, which tends to require short timeframes due to the assumption of a static environment. Unlike standard SLAM, lifelong SLAM is expected to operate despite environmental changes such as moved objects, lighting changes, dynamic objects within sensor view, etc. Some topics within the lifelong SLAM field have already been discussed, such as relocalization and map reuse. An exploration of previous lifelong SLAM work is provided below, grouped by the specific challenge addressed by the research.
