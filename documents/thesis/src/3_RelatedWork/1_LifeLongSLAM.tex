\subsection{Lifelong SLAM}

The term Lifelong SLAM has been used to refer to several topics related to SLAM research, but all share common themes related to:
\begin{singlespace}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Robust operation
        \item Over long time horizons
        \item In constantly changing environments
    \end{enumerate}
\end{singlespace}
This research adopts the definition provided by Shi et. al, describing lifelong SLAM as a problem of long-term robot deployments in wh
ich ``a robot that needs to operate around a particular region over an extended period of time, the capability of lifelong SLAM aims to build and maintain a persistent map of this region and to continuously locate the robot itself in the map during its operations''~\cite{shi2020openloris}.
