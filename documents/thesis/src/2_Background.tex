In this chapter, we provide a high level overview of SLAM, with special focus paid to the Keypoint-Based Visual SLAM modality, and the ORB-SLAM3 implementation. This research uses ideas from the field of Directional Statistics, so an overview of the subject and the Von-Mises Fisher distribution is provided.
