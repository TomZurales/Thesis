\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this chapter, we provide a high level overview of SLAM, with special focus paid to the Keypoint-Based Visual SLAM modality and the ORB-SLAM3 implementation. This research uses ideas from the field of Directional Statistics, so an overview of the subject and the Von-Mises Fisher distribution is provided.
