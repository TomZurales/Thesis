\subsection{Useful Constructs}

Future sections explore the mathematical backing and implementation of the proposed system, motivating the creation of a section of definitions and constructs which can be referenced going forward.

\subsubsection{Geometric}

\defitem{$d$}{A distance in the domain $d\in R^+$}\newline
\defitem{$V$}{The domain of all possible 3D viewpoints $V:\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}^+$}\newline
\defitem{$\boldsymbol{v}$}{A viewpoint in the domain $\boldsymbol{v}\in V$}\newitem{$o$}{An observation of the map point in the domain}

\subsubsection{Probabilistic}

\defitem{$E$}{The event that the map point exists}\newline
\defitem{$P(E)$}{The probability that the map point exists}\newline
\defitem{$S^{\boldsymbol{v}}$}{The event that the map point is seen from the given viewpoint $\boldsymbol{v}$}\newline
\defitem{$P(S^{\boldsymbol{v}})$}{The probability that the point is seen from the given viewpoint $\boldsymbol{v}$}
