\subsection{Useful Constructs}

Future sections explore the mathematical backing and implementation of the proposed system, motivating the creation of a section of definitions and constructs which can be referenced going forward.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic}

\defitem{$E$}{The event that the point exists}
\defitem{$P(E)$}{The probability that the point exists}
\defitem{$S^\mathbf{v}$}{The event that the map point is seen from the given viewpoint $}
\subsubsection{Geometric}
