\subsection{Method Overview}

\subsubsection{Directional Observability of Map Points}

% define what we mean by directional observability; a mapping between observation unit direction vector and seen/not seen binary observations

We define directional observability of a map point as a function from unit direction to binary visual observability
$$
    \mathbb{f:}\mathbb{S}^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}
$$

% Justify why distance needs to be accounted for, use a diagram to show that by including distance, we can account for occlusions in the model

This model of observability does not account for occlusions. Therefore, we instead utilize the function
$$
    \mathbb{S}
$$

% Say what we are trying to build; a model which can produce a probability that a point will be seen given an observation direction and a distance
