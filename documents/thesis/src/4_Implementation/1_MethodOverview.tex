\subsubsection{Viewpoint-Aware Observability of Map Points}

% define what we mean by viewpoint aware observability; a mapping between observation unit direction vector and seen/not seen binary observations

Let's step back for a moment recall the goal of this research. We are attempting to identify previously observed map points which are no longer observable in the map. Viewpoint-aware observability is a function characterized by a unit direction vector $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{S}^2$ and a distance $
$$
    \mathbb{S}^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}
$$

% Justify why distance needs to be accounted for, use a diagram to show that by including distance, we can account for occlusions in the model

This model of observability does not account for occlusions. Therefore, we instead utilize the function
$$
    \mathbb{S}
$$

% Say what we are trying to build; a model which can produce a probability that a point will be seen given an observation direction and a distance
