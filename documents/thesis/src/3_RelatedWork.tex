This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the wider body of SLAM research. The topics covered here are relevant to the objectives of this research, aiming to identify and remove data which could cause instability or error. The goals of this research align closely with the topics of semantic identification and lifelong SLAM. However, the methods of implementation and integration are most closely related to change detection, point stability and reobservability confidence. The following sections explore these topics in detail, and compared with the goals and methods proposed in this research.
