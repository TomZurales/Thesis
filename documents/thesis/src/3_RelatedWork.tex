This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the broader body of SLAM research. The topics discussed are selected for their relevance to two previously outlined objectives: the identification and removal of data that could cause instability, and the improvement of SLAM performance over long time horizons. While the goals of this research align with the topics of semantic rejection and lifelong SLAM, the methods applied are more closely related to change detection, point stability and re-observability confidence. The following sections explore the key ideas from these topics, and relate them to the proposed research.

\subsection{Change Detection}

In the context of SLAM, change detection refers to the identification of discrepancies between the map and the environment. In lifelong SLAM operations, change detection is often used to assist with map maintenance tasks by identifying areas of change and updating them to match the current environment. However, change detection has been used for many other purposes.

Larsen et al. \cite{larsenChangeDetectionModel} utilized pairs of images to identify geometric inconsistencies in existing 3D maps, allowing for the identification of individual
