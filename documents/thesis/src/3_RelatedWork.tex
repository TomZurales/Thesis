Numerous methods have been developed to improve long-term SLAM performance, generalizing the problem to remove the constraint that the environment remains static.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10710 - ChangingSlam - Uses a Bayes filter to remove changing map points. Utilizes semantic detection to determine dynamic objects before filter is used, which prevents it from working on deformable objects.
