This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the broader body of SLAM research. The topics discussed are selected for their relevance to two key objectives: the previously outlined objectives, specifically the identification and removal of data that could cause instability or errors. While the goals of this research align closely with semantic rejection and lifelong SLAM, the methods of implementation and integration are closely related to change detection, point stability and re-observability confidence. The following sections explore how these topics relate to the proposed research.
