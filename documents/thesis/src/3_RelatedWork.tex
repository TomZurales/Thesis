This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the broader body of SLAM research. The topics covered here are chosen based on their relevance to the previously outlined objectives, specifically the identification and removal of data that could cause instability or errors. While the goals of this research align closely with semantic identification and lifelong SLAM, the methods of implementation and integration are  closely related to change detection, point stability and reobservability confidence. The following sections explore these topics in detail, comparing with the proposed goals and methods.
