This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the broader body of SLAM research. The topics discussed are selected for their relevance to two previously outlined objectives: the identification and removal of data that could cause instability, and the improvement of SLAM performance over long time horizons. While the goals of this research align with the topics of semantic rejection and lifelong SLAM, the methods applied are more closely related to change detection, point stability and re-observability confidence. The following sections explore the key ideas from these topics, and relate them to the research proposed
