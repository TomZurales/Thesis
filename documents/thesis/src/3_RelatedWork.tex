\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

This chapter contextualizes this thesis within the broader body of SLAM research. The topics discussed are selected for their relevance to two previously outlined objectives: the identification and removal of data that could cause instability, and the improvement of SLAM performance over long time horizons. While the goals of this research align with the topics of semantic rejection and lifelong SLAM, the methods applied are more closely related to change detection, point stability and re-observability confidence. The following sections explore the key ideas from these topics, and relate them to the proposed research.

Some implmenetations have similar goals to this research, but differ significantly in implementation. However, they are worth mentioning as important advancements towards lifelong SLAM.

\subsection{Place Recognition over Long Time Horizons}

As previously discussed, place recognition refers to the ability to realize when an agent has entered a previously visited area. In KV-SLAM, this is regularly accomplished using a bag-of-words approach on binary feature discriptors extracted from localized images \cite{camposORBSLAM3AccurateOpenSource2021}. However, the extracted features can change significantly over time due to lighting changes, moved objects, viewpoint, etc. Milford et al. improved robustness to time of day and weather conditions by . Naseer et al. \cite{naseerVisionbasedMarkovLocalization2015} implemented long-term place recognition

\subsection{Change Detection for Map Maintenance}

Change detection in SLAM refers to identifying discrepencies between current sensor observations and the existing map. This functionality supports operations like relocalization and place recognition by acting as the mechanism through which outdated map data is identified.

The implementation of change detection depends on sensor modality and map structure




\subparagraph{Object Level}
Larsen et al. \cite{larsenChangeDetectionModel} utilized pairs of images to identify geometric inconsistencies in existing 3D maps, allowing for the identification of individual added or removed objects.

\subparagraph{Geometric Level}
Derner et al. \cite{dernerChangeDetectionUsing2021} assign a weight to each point to quantify its stability to movement.
