\subsection{Model Optimization and Analysis}

As stated in Section \ref{sec:implementation}, observability models are initialized with an implementation-dependent vector of parameters representing various tunable factors within the model. The selection of these parameters plays a large role in the effectiveness of the model. Therefore, these parameterizations must be optimized across a variety of representative situations
