\subsection{Model Optimization and Analysis}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:implementation}, observability models are initialized with an implementation-dependent vector of parameters that represent various tunable factors within the model. The setting of these parameters plays a large role in the effectiveness of the model. Therefore, these parameters must be optimized across a variety of representative situations to minimize the error between the estimated and actual observability of the map point.
