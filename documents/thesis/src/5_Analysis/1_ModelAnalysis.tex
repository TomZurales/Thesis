\subsection{Model Optimization and Analysis}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:implementation}, observability models are initialized with an implementation-dependent vector of parameters that represent various tunable factors within the model. The setting of these parameters significantly influences the model's effectiveness. Therefore, they must be optimized across a range of representative scenarios to minimize the error between the estimated and actual observability of the map point.
