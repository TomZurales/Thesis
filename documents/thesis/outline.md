* Introduction
  * paragraph - The problem with map reuse in long term SLAM, the solution using a viewpoint-aware model of map point observability, and the results of the work.
  * Motivation
    * paragraph - Describe the project that inspired this work; astrobee map reuse on the ISS.
    * paragraph - Describe how issues with long-term SLAM prevent wide usage in dynamic environments; maps can be used for other tasks
    * paragraph - Describe what benefits we can gain from solving these problems; more robustness, better maps, more accurate localization, etc.
  * Problem Statement
    * paragraph - Describe why current SLAM systems struggle to operate over long periods of time; map size increase, outdated map points leading to localization errors, bad loop closures...
    * paragraph - Describe the problems with existing map point culling methods, and why they are bad for low-compute platforms
  * Research Questions
    * paragraph - Is a viewpoint-aware model of map point existence an effective way to detect and cull outdated map points?
    * paragraph - What are the effects of this model on SLAM performance?
    * paragraph - Can this be implemented in a lightweight way capable of running on low-compute power platforms?
  * Objectives and Scope
    * paragraph - Define the scope of this work, focusing exclusively on map reuse between runs of SLAM in semi-static environments.
    * paragraph - Define the objectives of the model; to be lightweight and effective at identifying outdated map points, and to be usable in real-time SLAM systems.
    * paragraph - Define the objectives of the implementation, not to hurt performance in static environments, and to improve performance with previously generated maps in semi-static environments.
  * Contribution
