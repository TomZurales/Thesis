* Introduction
  * paragraph - The problem with map reuse in long term SLAM, the solution using a viewpoint-aware model of map point observability, and the results of the work.
  * Problem context
    * paragraph - Talk about time on the astrobee project and the problems encountered
    * paragraph - Key takeaways - We need map reuse for performant stochastic operation, oudated maps are a problem for localization
  * Problem Statement
    * paragraph - Describe what bad things happen when SLAM systems fail
    * paragraph - Describe why current SLAM systems struggle to operate over long periods of time; map size increase, outdated map points leading to localization errors, bad loop closures, etc.
    * paragraph - Describe the problems with existing methods for map reuse; they do not cull old map points(size increase), they are not lightweight(slows down SLAM), they do not account for viewpoint (leading to overly aggressive pruning).
    * paragraph - Describe the need for a point-level model of map point observability that is lightweight and effective at identifying outdated map points.
  * Research Questions
    * paragraph - Is a point-level model of map point observability accurate at identifying outdated map points?
    * paragraph - What are the effects of this model on SLAM performance?
    * paragraph - Can this be implemented in a lightweight way capable of running on low-compute power platforms?
  * Objectives and Scope
    * paragraph - Define the scope of this work, focusing exclusively on map reuse between runs of SLAM in semi-static environments.
    * paragraph - Define the objectives of the model; to be lightweight and effective at identifying outdated map points, and to be usable in real-time SLAM systems.
    * paragraph - Define the objectives of the implementation, not to hurt performance in static environments, and to improve performance with previously generated maps in semi-static environments.
    * paragraph - Define specifically what is not in scope; not a new SLAM system, not a new mapping method, strictly focused as an enhancement to existing keypoint-based visual SLAM.
  * Contribution
    * paragraph - The library: a lightweight, viewpoint-aware model of map point existence, designed to be utilized in keypoint-based visual SLAM systems.
    * paragraph - The SLAM implementation: An implementation of the library in ORB-SLAM 3 to demonstrate its effectiveness. Clarify that I'm not creating a new SLAM system, just an enhancement.
    * paragraph - The datasets: A set of datasets and experimental results demonstrating how the library improves SLAM performance.
