    This research details the implementation and analysis of a novel, viewpoint aware method for map point culling for use in keypoint based visual SLAM systems. This method makes use of perspective dependent shells around each map point, allowing for the storage of overall observability metadata using constant additional space. This metadata allows for the overall probability of a point's existence to be continuously calculated using a simple Bayesian update step. This existence probability can be used in a myriad of ways. This research explores its use as a method of culling outdated map points, such as those originally seen on an object which has since moved, and as an extension to the RANSAC algorithm, providing the ability to select more robust map points. We provide the implementation of the perspective aware metadata shell as an open-source library, as well as an ORB\_SLAM3 implementation utilizing the library for point culling and RANSAC improvement. Additionally, a set of co-registered visual-inertial-lidar datasets are released, containing scenarios specifically intended to exercise and characterize the performance of the system. Through our analysis, (discuss effects on well known, non-dynamic SLAM datasets, along with my datasets)
